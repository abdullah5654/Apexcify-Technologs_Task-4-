ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Object Detection & Tracking
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT.
The system captures video from a webcam (or video file), detects objects frame by frame, and assigns each object a unique ID to track them across frames.

ðŸš€ Features

Real-time video input via OpenCV.

Object detection with YOLOv8 (Ultralytics).

Object tracking with DeepSORT.

Bounding boxes with labels and unique IDs.

Works with both webcam and video files.
